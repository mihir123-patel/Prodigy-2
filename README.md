ðŸš¢ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset ðŸ“Š

Recently, I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The focus was on understanding key variables and discovering patterns that could explain survival rates.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, handled outliers, and transformed variables where necessary for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized relationships between key variables such as age, gender, class, and survival rate. For instance, passengers in first class had a significantly higher survival rate compared to those in lower classes, and gender played a pivotal role in survival.
Trends & Patterns: Identified trends in the data, such as higher survival rates for women and children, and examined how socio-economic factors influenced survival outcomes.
Tools Used:
pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
matplotlib & seaborn for creating insightful visualizations
This project deepened my understanding of the critical role that data cleaning and visualization play in uncovering meaningful insights from raw data.

Looking forward to applying these techniques in more real-world datasets!
